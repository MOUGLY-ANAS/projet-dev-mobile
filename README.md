POSTAL is a mobile application that, alike twitter and other social media platforms, displays a serial number of posts alongside with their captions, tags and of course number of likes. But it is much simpler due to the fact that it has restrained the functionalities gathering only the ones below :

1.Display the list of posts returned by the API whose link is the following : https://dummyapi.io/data/v1/post   . 

2.Click on a Post in order to view it in a new screen.

3.Delete a Post using a long click   .

4.Search posts by tag.

5.Create a post by entering: the ownerâ€™s ID, the image url, the caption and the tags.

6.Fetch more posts using infinite scroll loading.
